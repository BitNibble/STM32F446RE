NB:
Just Comment out in "stm32f4xx_it.c", the "void SysTick_Handler(void)" function definition, everything else will work.

After go to Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols
then link -> Includes
          -> Source Location

First enable clock, second configure peripheral, third enable module, fourth setup module.

To generate hex files:
Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU Post build outputs
then tick the box corresponding "Convert to Intel Hex file"

IDES, are just an abstraction to simplify coding in a logical and coherent manner, making it perceivable for man.

SysTick->LOAD does not accept values below 63 at fixed sysclk.

The RCC is specific to each Arm cpu, and must be specifically taylored.
